  description: This high-tech invention consists of a bow with a mechanism to easily
    pull back the drawstring and hold it in place, allowing for a far stronger shot
    than a conventional bow. An ergonomic grip and shoulder stock are also present
    to stabilise the weapon for improved accuracy. Who knows what the future will
    bring? Long-range optics? Replaceable magazines? Laser sights?
